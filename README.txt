This is a spare time project I wrote in the spring of 2021. At Paradox I was always using the in-house cross platform graphics pipeline, and I wanted to explore how a platform-specific implementation might work.

Setup:
Launch VS,
Create Windows Application from existing sources,
Set C++17,
Set Project/Property/Advanced/Character_Set to Unicode
Set Project/Properties/Debugging/Working Direction to "."
